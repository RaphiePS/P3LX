P2LX
====

P2LX is a Processing 2 wrapper library for the [LX](https://github.com/heronarts/LX) lighting engine.

It allows you to simply embed LX inside a Processing sketch and also includes UI libraries that makes rendering 3-D simulations with overlayed 2-D controls easy.

Building a big cool project? I'm probably interested in hearing about it! Drop me a line: mark@heronarts.com
